# Humble Beeing Blog Style Guide

Use this guide when drafting or editing long-form content for the Humble Beeing blog. It captures the voice, structure, and evidence-forward approach used in the refreshed EEAT-aligned articles (January 2025).

## Core Principles (EEAT)
- **Experience:** Share field anecdotes, harvest routines, on-the-ground tastings, and direct observations from Humble Beeing teams and partners.
- **Expertise:** Explain techniques, equipment, labs, or training credentials in plain language. Cite measurements (e.g., moisture %, temperature ranges) and standards followed.
- **Authoritativeness:** Reference accredited labs, industry certifications, or collaborations with chefs and retailers to reinforce credibility.
- **Trustworthiness:** Offer transparent sourcing, chain-of-custody notes, stockist details, and clear safety guidance. Show readers how to verify claims themselves.

## Voice & Tone
- Conversational, knowledgeable, and approachable—think a seasoned New Yorker writer who moonlights as a beekeeper.
- Dry wit is welcome, but keep jokes subtle and purposeful. Never undercut critical guidance or safety information.
- Validate reader concerns with empathy (e.g., storage in humid climates) before presenting solutions.
- Speak directly to the reader using second person ("you") while maintaining humility and authority.

## Structure & Formatting
1. **Headline (H1):** Always a direct question a user might type into Google. Example: `# How Should You Store Honey in Kampala’s Heat Without Losing Its Magic?`
2. **Hero Subtitle:** Reinforce the article promise in one sentence (experience-driven, value-forward).
3. **Introduction:** 1–2 paragraphs that set context, acknowledge the reader’s problem, and preview the solution.
4. **Body Sections (H2s):** Use instructive or investigative subheadings that also answer specific questions ("How we benchmark honey in 2025," "Why beeswax earns its clean reputation").
5. **Lists & Data:** Present technical specifics in bullet lists for scannability. Include measurements, standards, or process steps.
6. **Calls to Action:** Close with tailored CTAs pointing to relevant site sections (Contact & Connect, Wholesale & Partnerships, gifting guides, etc.).
7. **FAQs:** Finish with 3–5 high-intent FAQs using concise, authoritative answers; align with structured data expectations.

## Content Expectations by Section
- **Process Explanations:** Describe steps chronologically. Mention tools (refractometers, sous-vide sticks, ISO labs) and thresholds (temperature, moisture, time).
- **Sourcing & Logistics:** Name neighbourhoods, partner locations, and delivery windows. Provide practical verification tips (e.g., ask for batch cards, lab certificates).
- **Sensory Notes:** Use sensory language (aroma, texture, finish) and pairings rooted in real tastings with chefs or customers.
- **Risk & Safety:** Flag limitations or age restrictions candidly (e.g., raw honey and infants, candle safety distances). Offer actionable mitigation advice.
- **Humour Tags:** Limit to quick asides that reinforce expertise ("long wicks make drama, not romance"). Avoid sarcasm that could reduce trust.

## SEO & Accessibility
- Keep sentences crisp (~20–25 words) and favour active voice.
- Naturally incorporate target keywords and Kampala/Uganda location references without stuffing.
- Ensure all claims can be backed by internal documentation or reputable external sources; add links where appropriate.
- Maintain inclusive language; explain any regional jargon the first time it appears.

## Fact-Checking & Approvals
- Validate every statistic, lab result, and partner mention with the quality/operations team before publishing.
- Use the latest harvest data, stockist lists, and pricing (update quarterly or when operations change).
- Record updates in the content tracking sheet with "Author," "Reviewer," "Last QA," and "Data Sources."

## Example Paragraph Template
> “We harvest wax cappings alongside honey in Hoima, then render them at a patient 65 °C in small, food-grade kettles. Compared to paraffin—which is essentially refined petroleum—our beeswax produces negligible soot, neutralises airborne pollutants, and holds shape in Kampala without weeping.”

Aim for this balance of specific detail, contextual comparison, and warm authority in every section.
